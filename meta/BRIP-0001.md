## Summary

This BRIP introduces two complementary changes to Berachain's fee market:  

1. A **minimum gas price floor** of 10 gwei (10 × 10⁹ wei).  
2. A **modified base fee adjustment mechanism** that scales down the maximum allowable base fee change per block by a factor of the ratio between Ethereum’s 12s target block time and Berachain's 2s block time.

To enforce this requirement, forking of the execution client is required. For maintainability, only Geth and Reth forks will be supported by Berachain Labs.

## Motivation

- **Gas Price Floor**:
On a purely market-driven gas model, extremely low fees can incentivize flooding the network with spam, where bots will attempt to capitalize on miniscule arbitrage opportunies. This results in a negative transacting experience for other users.

- **Base Fee Adjustment**:
With 2s blocks, the current maximum 12.5% fee swing per block translates into excessive fee volatility on a per-second basis.

Concretely, our current maximum fluctuation is 6.25% per second. On Ethereum the current maximum fluctuation is ~1.05% per second.

By reducing the maximum base fee rate of change to ~2.1%, we reduce our per second maximum fluctuation to ~1.05%, providing a gas UX similar to Ethereum.

This allows wallets to better predict the appropriate base fee for transaction inclusion.

## Specification

### Base Fee Calculation

   Transaction validation will remain as is, where the transaction must be appropriately priced such that it is above the base fee. The base fee calculation MUST be revised as follows, compared to the [original EIP1559 spec](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md).

```diff

            )
            expected_base_fee_per_gas = parent_base_fee_per_gas + base_fee_per_gas_delta
        else:
            gas_used_delta = parent_gas_target - parent_gas_used
            base_fee_per_gas_delta = (
                parent_base_fee_per_gas * gas_used_delta
                // parent_gas_target
                // BASE_FEE_MAX_CHANGE_DENOMINATOR
            )
            expected_base_fee_per_gas = parent_base_fee_per_gas - base_fee_per_gas_delta
+       # enforce protocol minimum base fee
+       expected_base_fee_per_gas = max(expected_base_fee_per_gas, MIN_BASE_FEE)
        assert expected_base_fee_per_gas == block.base_fee_per_gas, \
            'invalid block: base fee not correct'

```

## Rationale

The approach of modifying the `BASE_FEE_MAX_CHANGE_DENOMINATOR` is well-adopted in other EVM chains.

## Backward Compatibility

A hard fork is required to enable these changes. This change is fully backward-compatible with existing wallet and applications as relevant ETH APIs will adjust based on the base fee.

## Security Considerations  

- Monitoring recommended to ensure denominator remains appropriate as network evolves.
